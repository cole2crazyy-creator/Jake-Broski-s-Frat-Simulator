Welcome to Frat Simulator, the outrageous free-roam college experience where parties, fights, and loyalty decide your fate. You play as Jake Broski, a high school senior stepping into the chaotic world of fraternities. Starting with low-tier houses that party hard but lack respect, your goal is to climb the ranks and earn a spot in the most legendary frat on campus.

Everything revolves around Aura, the stat that defines your reputation. Win fights to gain aura, walk away and lose it, or fail and risk dropping a whole rank. If you fall too low, you’ll get kicked out and forced into a weaker house. Earn loyalty by backing up your brothers, surviving hazing, and taking on challenges that grow tougher as you rise.

Jobs like bouncer, bartender, beer runner, or fight initiator let you earn Frat Bucks, the in-game currency. Use it to buy drinks, football tickets, and new jerseys. Jerseys aren’t just cosmetic—they boost aura, with white as starter gear and yellow as the ultimate symbol of status. Hats add style without affecting your rank, and everything you buy goes into your wardrobe.

Explore a fully enterable 3D campus town. Party in frat houses with LED lights, hit the liquor store to stock up, or catch games at the packed football stadium. Meet NPCs, make friends, and test your charm with the Rizz Meter. Build popularity by talking to girls, collecting numbers, and staying on top of your social game—but slip up and lose aura fast.

Parties aren’t always safe: police raids can cost you big unless you hide, run, or bail out brothers. Save allies from trouble and they’ll repay you with loyalty, beer, and aura boosts. Every choice matters, and every frat has unique responsibilities, rewards, and challenges.

Frat Simulator blends open-world exploration, social strategy, and high-stakes decision-making into one unforgettable college journey. Will you become the ultimate frat king—or the pledge who couldn’t hang?
